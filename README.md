React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. Here are some of the core concepts in React:

1. **Components**:
   - The building blocks of a React application. Components can be either class-based or function-based and represent pieces of the user interface.

2. **JSX (JavaScript XML)**:
   - A syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code within JavaScript. It makes it easier to visualize the structure of the UI.

3. **State**:
   - An object that holds dynamic data and determines how the component renders and behaves. State is mutable and managed within the component.

4. **Props (Properties)**:
   - Short for properties, props are read-only data passed from parent to child components. They allow data flow and customization of child components.

5. **Lifecycle Methods**:
   - Methods that allow executing code at specific points in a component's lifecycle (available in class components). Examples include `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

6. **Hooks**:
   - Functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Common hooks include `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and `useReducer`.

7. **Virtual DOM**:
   - An in-memory representation of the real DOM elements generated by React components. React updates the virtual DOM first, then efficiently updates the real DOM to match.

8. **Rendering**:
   - The process of transforming React components into DOM nodes. React uses a reconciliation algorithm to efficiently update the DOM to reflect the component state changes.

9. **Context API**:
   - Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It is useful for global state management.

10. **Refs**:
    - A way to access and interact with DOM elements or React elements directly. Created using `React.createRef` or `useRef` hook in functional components.

11. **React Router**:
    - A library for handling navigation and routing in React applications. It allows defining multiple routes and rendering different components based on the URL.

12. **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**:
    - Functions that take a component and return a new component with additional props or behavior. HOCs are used for reusing component logic.

13. **Controlled Components**:
    - Form elements (like input, textarea) that are controlled by React state. The state dictates the value of the input, and changes to the input update the state.

14. **Uncontrolled Components**:
    - Form elements that maintain their own state. React refs are used to access their values.

15. **Keys**:
    - Unique identifiers used in lists to help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed. They help in efficiently updating the list.

16. **Fragments**:
    - A way to group a list of children elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. Implemented using `<React.Fragment>` or shorthand syntax `<>`.

17. **Error Boundaries**:
    - Components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole application.

18. **Portals**:
    - A way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

19. **Reconciliation**:
    - The process by which React updates the DOM to match the virtual DOM. React compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one and makes the minimal necessary changes to the real DOM.

20. **Code Splitting**:
    - A technique to split the code into smaller bundles, which can be loaded on demand to improve the performance of a React application. Tools like `React.lazy` and `Suspense` are used for this purpose.

Understanding these core concepts will help you effectively build and manage React applications.
